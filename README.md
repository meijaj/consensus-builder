# Interlaboratory Consensus Builder
This calculator is aimed to assist data-reduction in support of interlaboratory comparisons.
At its core, it fits random effects model to the inter-laboratory data that consist of reported results and their associated measurement uncertainty.

This tool is similar to the NIST Consensus Builder (available from consensus.nist.gov or apps.ciaaw.org/app/nicob) and NIST Decision Tree (decisiontree.nist.gov). The Bayesian measurement model is adopted here and inference is done with Markov chain Monte Carlo using JAGS.
